libmormegil is a collection of library functions and C++ classes intended for
use in various projects that I host on github under the name fluffymormegil.

INSTALLATION
============
Some elements of libmormegil are self-contained single-header C++ classes
which you can safely copy directly into your own projects if you want. Others
are intended to be installed as system-wide shared libraries.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
================
The Salsa20 stream cipher was invented by Daniel J. Bernstein; the
implementation used in the libmormegil::S20prng C++ class is based on DJB's
public domain reference implementation.
