libmormegil is a collection of library functions and C++ classes intended for
use in various projects that I host on github under the name fluffymormegil.
It is released under the BSD licence (for reasons including "I'm not convinced
that the GNU LGPL has the effect I desire when applied to C++ templates").

== INSTALLATION ==

If you want to set up a system-wide installation,

        ./configure && make all && sudo make install

should do the trick. If it doesn't, let me know what platform you're on and
how to fix the issue.

== ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS ==

The Salsa20 stream cipher was invented by Daniel J. Bernstein; the
implementation used in the libmormegil::S20prng C++ class is based on DJB's
public domain reference implementation. If you want to use it for any
application involving ''actual cryptography'', please go directly to his
website rather than trusting my transcription of his algorithms.

== VERSION NUMBERING  ==
libmormegil's version number uses the format x.y.z with the following
meanings:

* X is the major version; this is presented as part of the shared library's
  soname, and provides guarantees about API/ABI compatibility.

* Y is the minor version.

* Z if the backwards-compatibility count. By libmormegil policy, this is
  '''always''' exactly zero.

If the library does something contrary to what the documentation states, 
both are wrong. The nature of the fix will depend on what the difference is.

If you want the official version of libmormegil to use ELF symbol versioning,
ask nicely and offer to pay me consultancy rates. (I will probably still say
"no".)

== CONTRIBUTION POLICY ==

Copyright assignment is neither required nor desired.

Contributions are accepted only under the terms of the BSD licence used on the
existing code.

== DO NOT REQUEST ==

=== Things not to submit ===

* Patches that depend on recursive make. '''Everything''' is built using
  the top-level Makefile.

* Patches that depend on GNU autotools or other such things.

=== Things not to request ===

Items on this list will not be done by me. Feel free to submit patches to
provide, on the understanding that if they break, I'm not likely to bother
fixing them:

* Support for building under Your Favourite GUI Tool
