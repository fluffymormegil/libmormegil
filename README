libmormegil is a collection of library functions and C++ classes intended for
use in various projects that I host on github under the name fluffymormegil.

== INSTALLATION

Some elements of libmormegil are self-contained single-header C++ classes
which you can safely copy directly into your own projects if you want. Others
are intended to be installed as system-wide shared libraries.

== ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The Salsa20 stream cipher was invented by Daniel J. Bernstein; the
implementation used in the libmormegil::S20prng C++ class is based on DJB's
public domain reference implementation.

== VERSION NUMBERING

libmormegil's version number uses the format x.y.z with the following
meanings:

* X is the major version; this is presented as part of the shared library's
  soname, and provides guarantees about API/ABI compatibility.

* Y is the minor version.

* Z if the backwards-compatibility count. By libmormegil policy, this is
  '''always''' exactly zero.

If the library does something contrary to what the documentation states, 
both are wrong. The nature of the fix will depend on what the difference is.

If you want the official version of libmormegil to use ELF symbol versioning,
ask nicely and offer to pay me consultancy rates. (I will probably still say
"no".)

== CONTRIBUTION POLICY

Copyright assignment is neither required nor desired.
