.SH NAME
libmormegil::emit_chebyshev_spiral \- print out source and header files for a chebyshev-metric spiral
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <libmormegil/srcgen-parts.hh>

\fBvoid libmormegil::emit_chebyshev_spiral(FILE *\fIsrcfile\fP, FILE *\fIhdrfile\fP, unsigned int \fIradius\fP, const char *\fImacrotag\fP, const char *\fInmsp\fP);\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION

.I libmormegil::emit_chebyshev_spiral
prints a C++ source file via the \fIFILE\fP object pointed to by \fIsrcfile\fP
and a C++ header file via the \fIFILE\fP object point to by \fIhdrfile\fP.

These output files describe the steps of a discrete spiral of radius
.I radius
under a Chebyshev metric, formatted as an array of (2 * radius + 1)^2 objects
of type \fIlibmormegil::Offset\fP. The array is named \fIcheby_spiral\fP and
can optionally be placed into a C++ namespace by passing a non-null pointer to
a non-empty C-style string as the argument \fInmsp\fP (which is null by
default). The character string pointed to by \fImacrotag\fP (default:
"cheby_spiral") is used as part of the include-guard macro string in the
emitted header file.

.SH CAVEATS

Does not check its inputs. The caller has responsiblity for managing the
objects pointed to by \fIsrcfile\fP and \fIhdrfile\fP, and for sanitizing the
strings passed as \fImacrotag\fP and \fInmsp\fP.

If you find yourself wanting a spiral larger than radius 20 or so, you may want
to re-evaluate the algorithm you were going to use it with.
